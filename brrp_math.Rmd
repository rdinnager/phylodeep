## Bayesian Regularised Regression on Phylogenies (BRRP)

A vector valued trait in species $i$, $T_i$ can be modeled as:

$$T_i = \alpha + \sum_j^{n_{\textrm{edge}}}\beta_j\gamma_j(i)$$

where $n_{\textrm{edge}}$ is the number of edges in the phylogeny and

$$\gamma_j(i) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
0 & j \notin P_i \\
l_j & j \in P_i
\end{array}\right.$$

where $P_i$ is the set of all edges leading from the root to species $i$, and $l_j$ is the branchlength associated with edge $j$. Then $\alpha$ is the trait value at the root (equivalent to the intercept in linear regression), and the $\beta_j$ parameters are the rates of evolution in the trait along edge $j$ (equivalent to regression coefficients). This is an over-parameterized linear regression. Over-parameterization is solved through regularisation (or weakly informative priors in the Bayesian formulation).
